<p class="about" style="margin-top: 30px;">Learning a new language is always intriguing and fascinating. As this can be a
means to explore a completely opposite culture to that of yours and also meeting
a different set of people that bring new views and beliefs. We thought why not
somehow combine both of these flavours together into one and make what we are
making now.</p>

<p class="about" style="margin-top: 20px;">We also thoroughly researched through the internet for such similar platforms and
much to our surprise there exists a plethora of similar websites. Our project is
different than those projects in a method that is completely untouched. That is
live translated chat. We have give the user the amenity to freely chat with their
newly found overseas ‘pal’. This will serve two purposes:</p>
<br>
<p class="about">1) The user gets to chat without worrying about not knowing the other
language, quite obvious.</p>
<p class="about" style="margin-top: 10px;">2) The other major use is that the user starts associating certain words in
the other language and effectively picking up the vocabulary of the
foreign language. Either, one could start off as a complete beginner in a
language or could come over online to brush up their skills.</p>
